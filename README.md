## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rejin â€” an Associate Manager with 9+ years of experience building and leading front-end applications. 

Right now, I'm diving deeper into AI and agent-based systems. Outside of tech, Iâ€™m also an artist. Sometimes digital, sometimes pencil and paper. Designâ€™s not just work for me â€” itâ€™s something I naturally gravitate toward.
